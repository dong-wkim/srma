| Condition or domain being studied                   | Knee and ankle outcome measures after primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery using peroneus longus tendon autograft.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |             |               |
| Rationale for the review                            | A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting outcomes using the peroneus longus tendon for ACLR –- whether single-arm syntheses or comparison between two methods of harvesting is not available in current literature. Results of this study will add significant value to the knowledge surrounding available graft options for ACLR surgery.                                                                                                                                                            |             |               |

| Review objectives                                   | Are the knee function outcomes of peroneus longus tendon autograft comparable to those of other graft options? Do the ankle function outcomes outweigh the donor-site morbidity and adverse events that arise from other graft harvesting locations? How does peroneus longus tendon harvesting with and without peroneus brevis tenodesis affect knee and ankle outcomes?                                                                                                                                               |             |               |

| Strategy for data synthesis                         | Extracted outcome data will be transformed into standardized continuous (i.e., sample size, mean, standard deviation) and dichotomous (i.e., sample size, event) data and synthesized using meta-analysis of random effects into pooled means and prevalences. Within study means will undergo inverse-variance weighted and DerSimonian-Laird methods and proportions will undergo inverse logit transformation and restricted maximum likelihood (REML) methods for pooled estimate and standard errors, respectively. |             |               |
| Analysis of subgroups or subsets                    | Subgroup analysis between PLT and PLBT will be performed to compare the effects of distal attachment during graft harvesting. Meta-regression analysis will be performed to control for the covariates (follow-up duration, mean age of participants, and gender) to determine whether the results are better explained by other predictors than variation in graft harvesting technique.                                                                                                                                |             |               |
